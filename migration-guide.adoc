== Default DDL type changes

=== UUID mapping changes on MariaDB

On MariaDB, the type code `SqlType.UUID` now by default refers to the DDL type `uuid`, whereas before it was using `binary(16)`.
Due to this change, schema validation errors could occur on existing databases.

The migration to `uuid` requires a migration expression like `cast(old as uuid)`.

To retain backwards compatibility, configure the setting `hibernate.type.preferred_uuid_jdbc_type` to `BINARY`.
