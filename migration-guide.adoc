This guide discusses migration from Hibernate ORM version 6.2. For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

== Default DDL type changes

=== UUID mapping changes on MariaDB

On MariaDB, the type code `SqlTypes.UUID` now by default refers to the DDL type `uuid`, whereas before it was using `binary(16)`.
Due to this change, schema validation errors could occur on existing databases.

The migration to `uuid` requires a migration expression like `cast(old as uuid)`.

To retain backwards compatibility, configure the setting `hibernate.type.preferred_uuid_jdbc_type` to `BINARY`.

=== UUID mapping changes on SQL Server

On SQL Server, the type code `SqlTypes.UUID` now by default refers to the DDL type `uniqueidentifier`, whereas before it was using `binary(16)`.
Due to this change, schema validation errors could occur on existing databases.

The migration to `uuid` requires a migration expression like `cast(old as uuid)`.

To retain backwards compatibility, configure the setting `hibernate.type.preferred_uuid_jdbc_type` to `BINARY`.

=== JSON mapping changes on Oracle

On Oracle 12.1+, the type code `SqlTypes.JSON` now by default refers to the DDL type `blob` and on 21+ to `json`, whereas before it was using `clob`.
Due to this change, schema validation errors could occur on existing databases.

The migration to `blob` and `json` requires a migration expression like `cast(old as blob)` and `cast(old as json)` respectively.

To get the old behavior, annotate the column with `@Column(definition = "clob")`.

This change was done because `blob` and `json` are way more efficient and because we don't expect wide usage of `SqlTypes.JSON` yet.

=== Column type inference for `number(n,0)` in native SQL queries on Oracle

Previously, since Hibernate 6.0, columns of type `number` with scale 0 on Oracle were interpreted as `boolean`, `tinyint`, `smallint`, `int`, or `bigint`,
depending on the precision.

Now, columns of type `number` with scale 0 are interpreted as `int` or `bigint` depending on the precision.

=== Removal of support for legacy database versions

This version introduces the concept of minimum supported database version for most of the database dialects that Hibernate supports. This implies that the legacy code for versions that are no longer supported by their vendors, has been removed from the hibernate-core module. It is, however, still available in the hibernate-community-dialects module.

The minimum supported dialect versions are as follows:

|===
|Dialect |Minimum supported version

|MySQL
|5.7

|SQL Server 2008
|10.0

|DB2
|10.5

|DB2i
|7.1

|DB2z
|12.1

|MariaDB
|10.3

|H2
|1.4.197

|Derby
|10.14.2

|Sybase
|16.0

|CockroachDB
|21.1

|PostgreSQL
|10.0

|Oracle
|11.2

|HSQLDB
|2.6.1

=== Change enhancement defaults and deprecation

The `enableLazyInitialization` and `enableDirtyTracking` enhancement tooling options in the ANT task, Maven Plugin and Gradle Plugin,
as well as the respective `hibernate.enhancer.enableLazyInitialization` and `hibernate.enhancer.enableDirtyTracking` configuration settings,
switched their default values to `true` and the settings are now deprecated for removal without replacement.
See link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15641[HHH-15641] for details.

The global property `hibernate.bytecode.use_reflection_optimizer` switched the default value to `true`
and the setting is now deprecated for removal without replacement. See link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15631[HHH-15631] for details.

=== Changes in Integration contracts (SPIs)

SPI is a category of interfaces that we strive to maintain with more stability than internal APIs, but which might change from minor to minor
upgrades as the project needs a bit of flexibility.

These are not considered public API so should not affect end-user (application developer's) code but such changes might break integration
with other libraries which integrate with Hibernate ORM.

During the development of Hibernate ORM 6.2 the following SPIs have seen some modifications:

==== EntityPersister#lock

Changed from `EntityPersister#lock(Object, Object, Object, LockMode, SharedSessionContractImplementor)` to `EntityPersister#lock(Object, Object, Object, LockMode, EventSource)`.
This should be trivial to fix as `EventSource` and `SharedSessionContractImplementor` are both contracts of the `SessionImpl`; to help transition we recommend using
the methods `isEventSource` and `asEventSource`, available on the `SharedSessionContractImplementor`contract.

N.B. method `asEventSource` will throw an exception for non-compatible type; but because of previous restrictions all invocations to `lock` actually had to be compatible:
this is now made cleared with the signature change.

==== EntityPersister#multiLoad

The same change was applieed to `multiLoad(Object[] ids, SharedSessionContractImplementor session, MultiIdLoadOptions loadOptions)`,
now migrated to `multiLoad(Object[] ids, EventSource session, MultiIdLoadOptions loadOptions)`

The same conversion can be safely applied.

==== Executable#afterDeserialize

As in the previous two cases, the parameter now accepts `EventSource` instead of `SharedSessionContractImplementor`.

The same conversion can be safely applied.

=== Changes to JdbcType

The return type of `JdbcType#getJdbcRecommendedJavaTypeMapping()` was changed from `BasicJavaType` to `JavaType`.
Even though this is a source compatible change, it breaks binary backwards compatibility.
We decided that it is fine to do this though, as this is a new minor version.
