<h2>Hibernate ORM Aggregated Javadoc</h2>

Hibernate provides:<ul>
    <li>
        a <em>native API</em> centered around {@link org.hibernate.SessionFactory} and
        {@link org.hibernate.Session},
    </li>
    <li>
        an implementation of the <em>Java (or Jakarta) Persistence API</em> (JPA), and
    </li>
    <li>
        a set of <em>mapping annotations</em> which augment the O/R mapping annotations defined by JPA,
        and which may be used with either API.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Native API</h3>

Along with {@link org.hibernate.SessionFactory} and {@link org.hibernate.Session}, applications using
the native API will often make use of the following interfaces:<ul>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration} to configure and bootstrap Hibernate,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.StatelessSession} for processes involving many entity instances,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.Transaction} to control local transactions, and</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.query.Query} to execute HQL queries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>JPA</h3>

The JPA interfaces are defined by the JPA specification. For details see the latest
<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/">specification</a> along with
{@link jakarta.persistence}.

<p>Note that since Hibernate 5.2, the native API extends the JPA API rather than wrapping it
(for example,<code>SessionFactory</code> extends <code>EntityManagerFactory</code>).</p>

<h3>Mapping annotations</h3>

See {@link org.hibernate.annotations}.

<h3>Note about package categories</h3>
Hibernate categorizes packages into a number of groups based on intended consumers:<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>API</strong> - classes to which application code will generally bind directly. These
        are generally classes which do not have "spi" nor "internal" in their package path and are
        not under the "org.hibernate.testing" package
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SPI</strong> - classes to which integrator developers will commonly bind directly in
        order to develop extensions to Hibernate, or to alter its behavior in some way. These are
        generally under packages with "spi" in the package path.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Testing Support</strong> - classes from the hibernate-testing artifact used in building
        Hibernate test cases. These are classes under the "org.hibernate.testing" package
    </li>
</ul>
