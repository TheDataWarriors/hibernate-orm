<h2>Hibernate ORM Aggregated Javadoc</h2>

Hibernate is a library for object/relation mapping (ORM). It provides:<ul>
    <li>
        a <em>native API</em> centered around {@link org.hibernate.SessionFactory} and
        {@link org.hibernate.Session},
    </li>
    <li>
        an implementation of the <em>Java (or Jakarta) Persistence API</em> (JPA),
        where the equivalent central interfaces are {@link jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory}
        and {@link jakarta.persistence.EntityManager}, and
    </li>
    <li>
        a set of <em>mapping annotations</em> which augment the O/R mapping annotations defined
        by JPA, and which may be used with either API.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Native API</h3>

Along with {@link org.hibernate.SessionFactory} and {@link org.hibernate.Session}, applications
using the native API will often make use of the following interfaces:<ul>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration} to configure and bootstrap Hibernate,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.StatelessSession} for processes involving many entity instances,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.Cache} to manage the second-level cache,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.Transaction} to control local transactions, and</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.query.Query} to execute HQL queries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>JPA</h3>

The JPA interfaces are defined by the JPA specification. For details see the latest
<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/">specification</a> along with the
<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/2.2/apidocs/">API documentation</a>
for the package {@link jakarta.persistence}.

<p>Note that since Hibernate 5.2, the native API extends the JPA API rather than wrapping it
(for example,<code>SessionFactory</code> extends <code>EntityManagerFactory</code>).</p>

<h3>Mapping annotations</h3>

The mapping annotations defined by the JPA specification provide a foundation for expressing
object/relational mappings in Hibernate and other JPA implementations.

The annotations in the package {@link org.hibernate.annotations} extend this foundation and
accommodate more specialized requirements. These annotation are not tied to the native API,
and may be used in conjunction with the JPA API.

The full power of Hibernate can only be unlocked via judicious use of these extra annotations.

<h3>Note about package categories</h3>

Hibernate categorizes packages into a number of groups based on intended consumers:<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>API</strong> - classes to which application code will generally bind directly.
        These  are generally classes which do not have <code>spi</code> nor <code>internal</code>
        in their package path and are not under the package <code>org.hibernate.testing</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SPI</strong> - classes to which integrator developers will commonly bind directly
        in order to develop extensions to Hibernate, or to alter its behavior in some way. These
        are generally under packages with <code>spi</code> in the package path.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Testing Support</strong> - classes from the <code>hibernate-testing</code>
        artifact used in building Hibernate test cases. These are classes under the package
        <code>org.hibernate.testing</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
