This project coordinates the tasks that need to be performed as part of creating a release for Hibernate.

== Artifacts

Both snapshot and release artifacts are published to Sonatype https://oss.sonatype.org/[OSSRH].

The "official" detials about OSSRH + Gradle can be found at https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-gradle/.
However, its content is way out of date as of the time of this writing.
https://dev.to/kengotoda/deploying-to-ossrh-with-gradle-in-2020-1lhi presents a much better guide.  Regardless,
This is all just for background; all of this information is "backed into" the build scripts.

After release, be sure to manage the staging repository created for it on https://oss.sonatype.org/[OSSRH].
