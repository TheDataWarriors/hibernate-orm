<h2>Hibernate ORM aggregated API documentation</h2>

<p>
    Hibernate is a library for object/relation mapping (ORM). It provides:
<ul>
    <li>
        a <em>native API</em> centered around {@link org.hibernate.SessionFactory} and
        {@link org.hibernate.Session},
    </li>
    <li>
        an implementation of the <em>Java (or Jakarta) Persistence API</em> (JPA),
        where the equivalent central interfaces are {@link jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory}
        and {@link jakarta.persistence.EntityManager}, and
    </li>
    <li>
        a set of <em>mapping annotations</em> which augment the O/R mapping annotations defined
        by JPA, and which may be used with either API.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Native API</h3>

<p>
    Along with {@link org.hibernate.SessionFactory} and {@link org.hibernate.Session}, applications
    using the native API will often make use of the following interfaces:
<ul>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration} to configure and bootstrap Hibernate,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.StatelessSession} for processes involving many entity instances,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.Cache} to manage the second-level cache,</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.Transaction} to control local transactions, and</li>
    <li>{@link org.hibernate.query.Query} to execute HQL queries.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>JPA</h3>

<p>
    The JPA interfaces are defined by the JPA specification. For details see the latest
    <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/">specification</a> along with the
    <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/2.2/apidocs/">API documentation</a>
    for the package {@link jakarta.persistence}.
</p>
<p>
    Note that since Hibernate 5.2, the native API extends the JPA API rather than wrapping it.
    For example,<code>SessionFactory</code> extends <code>EntityManagerFactory</code>, and
    <code>Session</code> extends <code>EntityManager</code>.
</p>

<h3>Mapping annotations</h3>

<p>
    The mapping annotations defined by the JPA specification provide a foundation for expressing
    object/relational mappings in Hibernate and other JPA implementations.
</p>
<p>
    The annotations in the package {@link org.hibernate.annotations} extend this foundation and
    accommodate more specialized requirements. These annotation are not tied to the native API,
    and may be used in conjunction with the JPA API.
</p>
<p>
    The full power of Hibernate can only be unlocked via judicious use of these extra annotations.
</p>

<h3>Package categories</h3>

<p>
    The organization of code into packages is based on the following classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>API packages</strong> include classes and interfaces which are used directly by
        a typical application. These packages never have <code>spi</code> nor <code>internal</code>
        in their name, and are not under the namespace <code>org.hibernate.testing</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SPI packages</strong> include classes and interfaces which are used by integrators,
        library developers, and framework developers to develop extensions to Hibernate, or to alter
        its behavior in some way. These packages usually have <code>spi</code> in their name.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some classes and interfaces are considered part of the internal implementation of Hibernate.
        This category includes packages with <code>internal</code> in their name, along with any class
        or interface annotated {@link org.hibernate.Internal @Internal}. Clients should avoid depending
        directly on these types.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>hibernate-testing</code> module, and the namespace <code>org.hibernate.testing</code>
        contain <strong>testing support</strong> used in the Hibernate test suite.
    </li>
</ul>
