/**

 * @apiNote The names used here are logical.  E.g. "inserting a row" may actually
 * execute an UPDATE statement instead of an INSERT.  This is generally
 * delineated based on whether there is a collection table involved or
 * not.  In standard Hibernate terms, this breaks down to the distinction
 * between {@link org.hibernate.persister.collection.BasicCollectionPersister}
 * and {@link org.hibernate.persister.collection.OneToManyPersister}.
