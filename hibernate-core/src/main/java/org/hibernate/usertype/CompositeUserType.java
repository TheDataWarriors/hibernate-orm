/**
 * A <tt>UserType</tt> that may be dereferenced in a query.
 * This interface allows a custom type to define "properties".
 * These need not necessarily correspond to physical JavaBeans
 * style properties.<br>
 * <br>
 * A <tt>CompositeUserType</tt> may be used in almost every way
 * that a component may be used. It may even contain many-to-one
 * associations.<br>
 * <br>
 * Implementors must be immutable and must declare a public
 * default constructor.<br>
 * <br>
 * Unlike <tt>UserType</tt>, cacheability does not depend upon
 * serializability. Instead, <tt>assemble()</tt> and
 * <tt>disassemble</tt> provide conversion to/from a cacheable
 * representation.
 * <br>
 * Properties are ordered by the order of their names
 * i.e. they are alphabetically ordered, such that
 * <code>properties[i].name &lt; properties[i + 1].name</code>
 * for all <code>i &gt;= 0</code>.
