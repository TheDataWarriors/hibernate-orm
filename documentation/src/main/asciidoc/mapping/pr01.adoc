Preface
~~~~~~~

The goal of this document is to discuss how to map an application's
domain model to a relational database.

Historically applications using Hibernate would have used its
proprietary XML mapping file format for this purpose. With the coming of
JPA, most of this information is now defined in a way that is portable
across ORM/JPA providers using annotations (and/or standardized XML
format). This document will focus on JPA mapping where possible. For
Hibernate mapping features not supported by JPA we will prefer Hibernate
extension annotations, again where possible.
