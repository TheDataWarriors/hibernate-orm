== Obtaining Hibernate

We may obtain any Hibernate module we need just by declaring a dependency on the module in our Maven or Gradle build.
For example, if we need `hibernate-core` we would simply declare a dependency on `org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-core`.

In Gradle we would have:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation 'org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-core:6.3.0.Final'
----

Or in Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.org</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.3.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
----
