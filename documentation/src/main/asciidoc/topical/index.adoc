= Topical Guides
:toc:

Hibernate documentation is organized into several guides that cover specific topics.  This guide provides links to
all the guides to give some direction on where to look for information.

NOTE: This is still very much a work in progress. <<helping,Help>> is definitely welcome!

== User Guides

* For information on bootstrapping Hibernate
** For bootstrapping a SessionFactory, see the <<bootstrap/NativeBootstrapping.adoc#native-bootstrap,Native Bootstrapping Guide>>

== Helping

* These "topical guides" are developed using Asciidoctor.  Meanwhile the legacy Hibernate reference manuals are
written in  DocBook.  The conversion of knowledge into the "topical guide" format will take time and is an
ongoing process.  A huge way to help would be to create topical guide(s) and pull over the relevant information
from the corresponding reference information.  See the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-8606[Jira task] for
a list of ideas
* Reporting/fixing problems.  Report any typos or inaccurate information to the
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH[Hibernate ORM Jira] using the +documentation+ component.  Follow the same
guidelines for contributing fixes and improvements as for contributing source code.
