== Preface

Jakarta Data is a new specification for _repositories_.
A repository, in this context, means an interface exposing a typesafe API for interacting with a datastore.
Jakarta Data is designed to accommodate a diverse range of database technologies, from relational databases, to document databases, to key-value stores and more.

Hibernate Data Repositories is an implementation of Jakarta Data targeting relational databases and backed by Hibernate ORM.
Entity classes are mapped using the familiar annotations defined by Jakarta Persistence.
On the other hand, the programming model for interacting with the database is quite different in Jakarta Data from the model you might be used to from Jakarta Persistence.

Therefore, this document will show you a different way to use Hibernate.
