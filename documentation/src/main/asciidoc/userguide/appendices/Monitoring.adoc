== Monitoring with Java Flight Recorder
:sourcedir: extras

Hibernate can provide an integration with Java Flight Recorder in order to monitor low level events like:

* opening and closing of a Hibernate Session
* acquisition and release of a JDBC connection
* ``PreparedStatement``s creation and execution
* batching execution
* second level cache PUT and GET operation
* flush and partial flush execution
* dirty check calculation

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the Java Flight Recorder integration, the application must include the `hibernate-jfr` jar on the classpath
====

[NOTE]
====
The `hibernate-jfr` integration requires JDK 17 (it should work also with JDK 11, but we haven't tested it) that also supports Java Flight Recorder Events.
