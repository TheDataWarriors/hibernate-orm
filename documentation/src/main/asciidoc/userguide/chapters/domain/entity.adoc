[[entity-pojo]]
==== POJO Models

Section _2.1 The Entity Class_ of the _JPA 2.1 specification_ defines
its requirements for an entity class. Applications that wish to remain
portable across JPA providers should adhere to these requirements.

* The entity class must be annotated with the `javax.persistence.Entity`
annotation (or be denoted as such in XML mapping)
* The entity class must have a public or protected no-argument
constructor. It may define additional constructors as well.
* The entity class must be a top-level class.
* An enum or interface may not be designated as an entity.
* The entity class must not be final. No methods or persistent instance
variables of the entity class may be final.
* If an entity instance is to be used remotely as a detached object, the
entity class must implement the Serializable interface.
* Both abstract and concrete classes can be entities. Entities may
extend non-entity classes as well as entity classes, and non-entity
classes may extend entity classes.
* The persistent state of an entity is represented by instance
variables, which may correspond to JavaBean-style properties. An
instance variable must be directly accessed only from within the methods
of the entity by the entity instance itself. The state of the entity is
available to clients only through the entityâ€™s accessor methods
(getter/setter methods) or other business methods.

Hibernate, however, is not as strict in its requirements. The
differences from the list above include:

* The entity class must have a no-argument constructor, which may be
public, protected or package visibility. It may define additional
constructors as well.
* The entity class _need not_ be a top-level class.
* Technically Hibernate can persist final classes or classes with final
persistent state accessor (getter/setter) methods. However, it is
generally not a good idea as doing so will stop Hibernate from being
able to generate proxies for lazy-loading the entity.
* Hibernate does not really care if you expose direct access to your
instance variables and use them from outside the entity itself. The
validity of such a paradigm, however, is debatable at best.

Let's look at each requirement in detail.

[[entity-pojo-final]]
==== Prefer non-final classes

A central feature of Hibernate is the ability to lazy load an entity's data via runtime proxies.
This feature depends upon the entity class being non-final or else implementing an interface that declares all the attribute getters/setters.
You can still persist final classes that do not implement such an interface with Hibernate; you just will not be able to use proxies for lazy association fetching which will ultimately limit your options for performance tuning.
You should also avoid declaring persistent attribute getters and setters as final for the reasons already mentioned.

[NOTE]
====
Starting in 5.0 Hibernate offers a more robust version of bytecode enhancement as another means for handling lazy loading.
Hibernate had some bytecode re-writing capabilities prior to 5.0 but they were very rudimentary.
====

[[entity-pojo-constructor]]
==== Implement a no-argument constructor

The entity class should have a no-argument constructor. Both Hibernate and JPA require this.

JPA requires that this constructor be defined as public or protected.
Hibernate for the most part does note care about the visibility as long as the system's SecurityManager allows overriding the visibility.
That said, the constructor should be defined with at least package visibility if you wish to leverage runtime proxy generation.

[[entity-pojo-accessors]]
==== Declare getters and setters for persistent attributes

Standard, portable JPA essentially requires this.
Otherwise your model would violate the requirement quoted above in regards to accessing the entity persistent state fields directly from outside the entity itself.

Although Hibernate does not require it, it is recommended to follow
JavaBean conventions by defining getters and setters for you entities
persistent attributes. You can still tell Hibernate to directly access
the entity's fields.

Attributes (whether fields or getters/setters) need not be declared
public. Hibernate can deal with attributes declared with public,
protected, package or private visibility. Again, if wanting to use
runtime proxy generation for lazy loading the visibility for the
getter/setter should be at least package visibility.

[[entity-pojo-identifier]]
==== Provide identifier attribute(s)

[NOTE]
====
Historically this was considered optional. However, not defining
identifier attribute(s) on the entity should be considered a deprecated
feature that will be removed in an upcoming release.
====

The identifier attribute does not necessarily need to be mapped to the
column(s) that physically define the primary key. However, it should map
to column(s) that can uniquely identify each row.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We recommend that you declare consistently-named identifier attributes on persistent classes and that you use a nullable (i.e., non-primitive) type.
====

[[entity-pojo-mapping]]
==== Mapping the entity

The main piece in mapping the entity is the `javax.persistence.Entity`
annotation. The Entity annotation defines just one attribute `name`
which is used to give the entity a specific name for use in JPQL
queries; by default the name is the unqualified name of the entity
class.

An entity models a database table. The identifier uniquely identifies
each row in that table. By default the name of the table is assumed to
be the same as the name of the entity. To explicitly give the name of
the table or to specify other information about the table, we would use
the `javax.persistence.Table` annotation.

[[mapping-model-pojo-equalshashcode]]
==== Implementing `equals()` and `hashCode()`

[NOTE]
====
Much of the discussion in this section deals with the relation of an entity to a Hibernate Session; whether the entity is managed or transient or detached.
These topics are explained in <<chapters/pc/PersistenceContext.adoc#pc,Persistence Context>> if you are unfamiliar with them.
====

Whether to implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in your domain model, let alone how to implement them, is a surprisingly tricky discussion when it comes to ORM.

There is really just one absolute case: a class that acts as an identifier must implement equals/hashCode based on the id value(s).
Generally this is pertinent for user classes used as composite identifiers.
Beyond this one absolute case and the few others we will discuss below, you may want to consider not implementing equals/hashCode.

So what's all the fuss? Normally, most Java objects provide a built-in `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on the object's identity, so each new object will be different from all others.
This is generally what you want in ordinary Java programming.
Conceptually however this starts to break down when you start to think about the possibility multiple instances of a class representing the same data which is in fact the case when we start dealing with data from a database.
Every time we load a specific `Person` from the database we would naturally get a unique instance.
Hibernate, however, works hard to make sure that does not happen within a given `Session`.
In fact Hibernate guarantees equivalence of persistent identity (database row) and Java identity inside a particular session scope.
So if we ask a Hibernate `Session` to load that specific Person multiple times we will actually get back the same __instance__:

.Scope of identity
====

Consider another example using a persistent `java.util.Set`:

.Set usage with Session-scoped identity
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing3.java[]

However, the semantic changes when we mix instances loaded from different Sessions:

.Mixed Sessions

----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing2.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing4.java[]
----
====

Specifically the outcome in this last example will depend on whether the `Person` class implemented equals/hashCode, and, if so, how.

Consider yet another case:

.Sets with transient entities
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing5.java[]
----
====

In cases where you will be dealing with entities outside of a Session (whether they be transient or detached), especially in cases where you will be using them in Java collections,
you should consider implementing equals/hashCode.

A common initial approach is to use the entity's identifier attribute as the basis for equals/hashCode calculations:

.Naive equals/hashCode implementation
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing6.java[]
----
====

It turns out that this still breaks when adding transient instance of `Person` to a set as we saw in the last example:

.Still trouble
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing7.java[]
----
====

The issue here is a conflict between (1) the use of generated identifier and (2) the contract of `Set` and (3) the equals/hashCode implementations.
`Set` says that the equals/hashCode value for an object should not change while it is part of the Set.
But that is exactly what happened here because the equals/hasCode are based on the (generated) id, which was not set until the `session.getTransaction().commit()` call.

Note that this is just a concern when using generated identifiers.
If you are using assigned identifiers this will not be a problem, assuming the identifier value is assigned prior to adding to the `Set`.

Another option is to force the identifier to be generated and set prior to adding to the `Set`:

.Forcing identifier generation
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing8.java[]
----
====

But this is often not feasible.

The final approach is to use a "better" equals/hashCode implementation, making use of a natural-id or business-key.

.Better equals/hashCode with natural-id
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/entity/listing9.java[]
----
====

As you can see the question of equals/hashCode is not trivial, nor is there a one-size-fits-all solution.

[[entity-pojo-optlock]]
==== Mapping optimistic locking

JPA defines support for optimistic locking based on either a version
(sequential numeric) or timestamp strategy. To enable this style of
optimistic locking simply add the `javax.persistence.Version` to the
persistent attribute that defines the optimistic locking value.
According to JPA, the valid types for these attributes are limited to:

* int, or Integer
* short, or Short
* long, or Long
* java.sql.Timestamp

.Version

====

Hibernate supports a form of optimistic locking that does not require a
dedicated "version attribute". This is intended mainly for use with
modeling legacy schemas. The idea is that you can get Hibernate to
perform "version checks" using either all of the entity's attributes, or
just the attributes that have changed. This is achieved through the use
of the `org.hibernate.annotations.OptimisticLocking` annotation which
defines a single attribute of type
`org.hibernate.annotations.OptimisticLockType`. There are 4 available
OptimisticLockTypes:

* `NONE` - optimistic locking is disabled. Even if there is a @Version
annotation present.
* `VERSION` (the default) - performs optimistic locking based on a
@Version as described above.
* `ALL` - Perform optimistic locking based on *all* fields as part of an
expanded WHERE clause restriction for the UPDATE/DELETE SQL statement.
* `DIRTY` - Perform optimistic locking based on *dirty* fields as part
of an expanded WHERE clause restriction for the UPDATE/DELETE SQL
statement
