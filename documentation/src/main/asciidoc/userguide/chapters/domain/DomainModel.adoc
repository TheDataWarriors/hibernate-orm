== Domain Model
:sourcedir: extras

The term https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model[domain model] comes from the realm of data modeling.
It is the model that ultimately describes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_domain[problem domain] you are working in.
Sometimes you will also hear the term _persistent classes_.

Ultimately the application's domain model is the central character in an ORM.
They make up the classes you wish to map. Hibernate works best if these classes follow the Plain Old Java Object (POJO) / JavaBean programming model.
However, none of these rules are hard requirements.
Indeed, Hibernate assumes very little about the nature of your persistent objects. You can express a domain model in other ways (using trees of `java.util.Map` instances, for example).
