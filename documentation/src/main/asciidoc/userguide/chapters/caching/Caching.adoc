[[caching-config]]
=== Configuring second-level caching

Hibernate defines the ability to integrate with pluggable providers for the purpose of caching data outside the context of a particular `Session`.
This section defines the settings which control that behavior.

[[caching-config-provider]]
=== RegionFactory

`org.hibernate.cache.spi.RegionFactory` defines the integration between Hibernate and a pluggable caching provider.
`hibernate.cache.region.factory_class` is used to declare the provider to use. Hibernate comes with support for 2 popular caching libraries: Ehcache and Infinispan.

[[caching-config-provider-ehcache]]
=== Ehcache

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use of the build-in integration for Ehcache requires that the hibernate-ehcache module jar (and all of its dependencies) are on the classpath.
====

The hibernate-ehcache module defines 2 specific region factories: `EhCacheRegionFactory` and `SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory`.

=== Infinispan

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use of the build-in integration for Infinispan requires that the hibernate-infinispan module jar (and all of its dependencies) are on the classpath.
====

The hibernate-infinispan module defines 2 specific providers: `infinispan` and  `infinispan-jndi`.

[[caching-config-behavior]]
=== Caching behavior

Besides specific provider configuration, there are a number of configurations options on the Hibernate side of the integration that control various caching behavior:

`hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache`:: Enable or disable second level caching overall. Default is true, although the default region factory is `NoCachingRegionFactory`.
`hibernate.cache.use_query_cache`:: Enable or disable second level caching of query results. Default is false.
`hibernate.cache.query_cache_factory`:: Query result caching is handled by a special contract that deals with staleness-based invalidation of the results.
The default implementation does not allow stale results at all. Use this for applications that would like to relax that.
Names an implementation of `org.hibernate.cache.spi.QueryCacheFactory`
`hibernate.cache.use_minimal_puts`:: Optimizes second-level cache operations to minimize writes, at the cost of more frequent reads. Providers typically set this appropriately.
`hibernate.cache.region_prefix`:: Defines a name to be used as a prefix to all second-level cache region names.
`hibernate.cache.default_cache_concurrency_strategy`:: In Hibernate second-level caching, all regions can be configured differently including the concurrency strategy to use when accessing the region.
This setting allows to define a default strategy to be used.
This setting is very rarely required as the pluggable providers do specify the default strategy to use.
Valid values include:
* read-only,
* read-write,
* nonstrict-read-write,
* transactional
hibernate.cache.use_structured_entries:: If `true`, forces Hibernate to store data in the second-level cache in a more human-friendly format.
Can be useful if you'd like to be able to "browse" the data directly in your cache, but does have a performance impact.
* hibernate.cache.auto_evict_collection_cache:: Enables or disables the automatic eviction of a bidirectional association's collection cache entry when the association is changed just from the owning side.
This is disabled by default, as it has a performance impact to track this state.
However if your application does not manage both sides of bidirectional association where the collection side is cached, the alternative is to have stale data in that collection cache.

[[caching-management]]
=== Managing the Cached Data

At runtime Hibernate handles moving data into and out of the second-level cache in response to the operations performed by the `Session`.

The `org.hibernate.Cache` interface (or the `javax.persistence.Cache` interface if using JPA) allow to clear data from the second-level cache.
