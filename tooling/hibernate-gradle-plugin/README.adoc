= Hibernate ORM Gradle Plugin

A Gradle plugin for introducing Hibernate tasks and capabilities into a build.


== Set up

```
plugins {
  id 'org.hibernate.orm' version='X'
}

// HibernateOrmSpec
hibernate {
  ...
}
```

== Bytecode Enhancement

The plugin can perform build-time enhancement of the domain classes.  This is controlled
by the `enhancement` portion of the `hibernate` extension:

```
hibernate {
  // EnhancementSpec
  enhancement {
    // available options - all default to false
    lazyInitialization( true )
  }
}
```

== DSL

The `hibernate` DSL extension is the main entry into configuring the plugin

```
hibernate {
}
```

At this time, there is no configuration at this level.
