I checked and found that hibernateorm does not support tiberoDB. If we implement the functions we need to support tiberoDB, can you reflect it?
- May I know what functions should be mainly implemented?
- How should I proceed with the application process for reflection after implementation?
- Is there any data related to the processing of previous new DB applications?

TiberoDB
- TiberoDB is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by TmaxSoft in Korea.
- Tibero was developed with the goal of high compatibility with Oracle and designed to be compatible with various database applications used in corporate environments.
